# QA Analyst – Portfolio

## 60-Second Overview (For Reviewers)

**Problem:**  
Many enterprise products rely heavily on managed workflows for small and medium use cases, creating operational bottlenecks, slow time-to-market, and limited scalability.

**Solution:**  
A controlled **Self-Service (DIY) Campaign Builder** that enables eligible users to configure and launch campaigns independently, while enforcing compliance, pricing, and governance guardrails.

**Quality Strategy:**  
Treat Quality Assurance as **Quality Insurance** — focusing on:
- Risk-based coverage  
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria  
- End-to-end UAT with traceability  
- Data-informed Go / No-Go decisions  

**Outcome:**  
Improved scalability, faster releases, reduced operational dependency, and confident product launches without compromising compliance or quality.
